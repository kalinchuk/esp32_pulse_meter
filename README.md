# ESP32 Pulse Water Meter

The following schematic and YAML are for building and configuring a pulse water meter reader using an ESP32 board and [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/). Watch the build on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/UIU_M9MApd0).

## Schematic
The schematic is using the ESP32-WROOM DevKitC board since it contains an external antenna connection.

## YAML Configuration

Create a new ESP32 device in ESPHome and use the following YAML configuration underneath the default configuration that is created in the device YAML file.

Note that this configuration is using pin GPIO26 to read one water meter and that `pullup` is enabled. You can find more information at the [ESPHome documentation](https://esphome.io/components/sensor/pulse_counter.html).
